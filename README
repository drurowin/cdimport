cdimport - semi-automatic CD import script

cdimport imports a CD (or otherwise collected files of music) into a
set location using FFmpeg. By default, the file name is parsed to
compute the track number and track title. All metadata supported by
the FLAC container (which is to say, basically anything you think of)
is supported. Track-specific metadata is supported. Since cdimport
uses FFmpeg, any input format that FFmpeg can read, cdimport can work
with (even if half of it is AIFF, and half is WAV!).

This script has been written with the opinion that a computer should
store lossless copies of CD audio. Popular disk drives are large and
cheap enough to support this ideal. As such, support for "lossy"
formats like MPEG audio and Vorbis will never be officially
included. If such a need arises, use your favorite conversion utility
to do the translation, or modify the script yourself.

For a brief synopsis of options, call the program with no
arguments. For greatly detailed information, use the `-h' or `--help'
flags.
